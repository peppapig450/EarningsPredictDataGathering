# TODO

## Actual TODO in program
- [] Improve type hinting and add documentation for gather_all_data and upcoming_earnings_history + any other file
- [] Write tests for those files too
- [] Data verification for python
  - Potentially make sure that stocks gathered by fmpsdk are valid before we loop (Symbols class)
- [] improve caching so that all the fetch methods in gather_all_data use it
- [] Setup command line input or config file reading

## Research for Data Analysis program
- [] Explore Parquet for data output for time series
- [] Combination of parquet and Sql
- [] Julia, Scala, or Clojure for actual analysis program
